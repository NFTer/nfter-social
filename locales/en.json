For our platform, anyone can create a feed, and posting an NFT is like posting a feed. The released NFT can flow freely on the social market, and gradually build an open and permissionless platform based on the creator economy. And compared with air coins, NFT is content-oriented and can better capture the native value of network content."

It can be said that showing off is the original demand of human beings. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes believes that the value of NFTs is to present themselves to others, and it will represent the ultimate way to demonstrate social status in a purely digital world. The current atmosphere of NFT is scarce and worthless. The reason for its worthlessness is that there are too few NFT use cases. We are currently committed to expanding the use cases of NFT."

Second, just like the fan economics of a thousand die-hard fans, NFT provides creators with the independent pricing power of content to maximize the creator's income. The third is that we are committed to creating a license-free market, and the platform does not require marketing costs. Whether it is our subsequent development of the NFT advertising system or the model of taking a share, it can directly generate revenue for the platform."

Users can digitally sign the NFT by asking the creator or big V to establish the relationship between fans and creators, and improve or enhance the NFT asset itself. The above will also involve NFT synthesis, as well as multi-person NFT synthesis, we call it the social synthesis of NFT, as well as the fragmentation function of NFT.
